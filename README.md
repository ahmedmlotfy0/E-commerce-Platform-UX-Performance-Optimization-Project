# E-commerce Platform UX & Performance Optimization Project

**Project created for the Sprints & Microsoft Project Management Certificate | [span_0](start_span)[span_1](start_span)August - October 2025**[span_0](end_span)[span_1](end_span)

[span_2](start_span)This repository contains the complete project management documentation for the strategic overhaul of the "DemoBlaze" e-commerce website[span_2](end_span). [span_3](start_span)The goal was to conduct a data-driven analysis of the user experience, identify critical performance bottlenecks, and develop a comprehensive, actionable plan for improvement[span_3](end_span).

The individual project deliverables can be found in the `/Project-Documents` folder.
## 1. Project Objective

[span_4](start_span)To diagnose and resolve key usability and performance issues on the DemoBlaze platform[span_4](end_span). [span_5](start_span)The primary success metrics were to enhance user satisfaction[span_5](end_span)[span_6](start_span), increase trust[span_6](end_span)[span_7](start_span), and improve the conversion rate by creating a faster, more intuitive shopping experience[span_7](end_span).
## 2. The Problem: A Data-Driven Diagnosis

[span_8](start_span)A mixed-methods approach combining heuristic analysis[span_8](end_span) [span_9](start_span)and user testing with 15 participants[span_9](end_span) revealed several high-priority issues:

| Category          | Issue Description                                       | Supporting Data                                                              | Impact |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| **Performance** | Slow page load times create a poor user experience.     | **[span_10](start_span)[span_11](start_span)5.8-second average page load time**[span_10](end_span)[span_11](end_span) [span_12](start_span)[span_13](start_span)due to unoptimized images[span_12](end_span)[span_13](end_span).             | High   |
| **Checkout Flow** | The checkout process is unnecessarily long and complex. | **[span_14](start_span)[span_15](start_span)5 steps required to complete a purchase**[span_14](end_span)[span_15](end_span), leading to high cart abandonment. | High   |
| **Usability** | Cart management is unintuitive.                         | **[span_16](start_span)10 out of 15 users** found removing items from the cart difficult[span_16](end_span).         | High   |
| **Trust Signals** | The site lacks clear indicators of security and trust.  | **[span_17](start_span)10 of 15 users** did not notice payment logos[span_17](end_span)[span_18](start_span); policies were hard to find[span_18](end_span). | High   |
| **UI/UX** | Product presentation is weak.                           | **[span_19](start_span)12 of 15 users** felt image quality was too low and lacked a zoom feature[span_19](end_span). | High   |

### Key User Feedback:
* [span_20](start_span)"Checkout should be faster, maybe in fewer steps."[span_20](end_span)
* [span_21](start_span)"Images need to be bigger and clearer."[span_21](end_span)
* [span_22](start_span)"I’d like to see the return policy before buying."[span_22](end_span)
* ## 3. The Solution: A Three-Sprint Release Plan (v2.0)

[span_23](start_span)I developed a prioritized, agile-based project plan to address these findings over three distinct sprints for Release v2.0[span_23](end_span).

### Sprint 1: Foundational Usability & Trust
* **Focus:** Quick wins to improve cart management and information clarity.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * [span_24](start_span)[span_25](start_span)Implement visible "Remove" buttons in the cart with an "Undo" option[span_24](end_span)[span_25](end_span).
    * [span_26](start_span)[span_27](start_span)Redesign price display to show the original price, discounted price, and percentage saved[span_26](end_span)[span_27](end_span).
    * [span_28](start_span)[span_29](start_span)Add highly visible links to return and shipping policies on product and checkout pages[span_28](end_span)[span_29](end_span).

### Sprint 2: Enhancing Product Presentation
* **Focus:** Improving product visuals and building user confidence before purchase.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * [span_30](start_span)[span_31](start_span)[span_32](start_span)Upgrade all product images to high-resolution and implement a zoom feature[span_30](end_span)[span_31](end_span)[span_32](end_span).
    * [span_33](start_span)[span_34](start_span)Add a prominent section for trusted payment logos (Visa, MasterCard, PayPal) at checkout[span_33](end_span)[span_34](end_span).

### Sprint 3: Performance & Checkout Overhaul
* **Focus:** Major technical improvements to increase site speed and streamline conversions.
* **Key Tasks:**
    * [span_35](start_span)[span_36](start_span)Redesign the checkout flow from 5 steps to a streamlined 3-4 step process with a progress bar[span_35](end_span)[span_36](end_span).
    * [span_37](start_span)[span_38](start_span)[span_39](start_span)Optimize all images, enable lazy loading, and minify CSS/JS to achieve a **page load time of ≤ 3 seconds**[span_37](end_span)[span_38](end_span)[span_39](end_span).
    * [span_40](start_span)Conduct final performance testing to validate speed improvements[span_40](end_span).
